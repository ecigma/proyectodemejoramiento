<p>
Have you ever played Minesweeper? It's a cute little game which comes within a certain 
Operating System which name we can't really remember. Well, the goal of the game is to
find where are all the mines within a MxN field. To help you, the game shows a number
in a square which tells you how many mines there are adjacent to that square. For instance,
supose the following 4x4 field with 2 mines (which are represented by an * character):
</p><pre>*...
....
.*..
....
</pre>
If we would represent the same field placing the hint numbers described above, we would end up with:
<pre>*100
2210
1*10
1110
</pre>
As you may have already noticed, each square may have at most 8 adjacent squares.

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001003000000000000000">The Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
The input will consist of an arbitrary number of fields. The first line of each field contains
two integers n and m (0 &lt; n,m &lt;= 100) which stands for the number of lines and columns of the field
respectively. The next n lines contains exactly m characters and represent the field. Each safe
square is represented by an "." character (without the quotes) and each mine square is represented
by an "*" character (also without the quotes). The first field line where n = m = 0 represents the end 
of input and should not be processed.

</p><h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001004000000000000000">The Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
For each field, you must print the following message in a line alone:
</p><pre>Field #x:</pre>
Where x stands for the number of the field (starting from 1). The next n lines should
contain the field with the "." characters replaced by the number of adjacent mines
to that square. There must be an empty line between field outputs.

Field #2:
**100
